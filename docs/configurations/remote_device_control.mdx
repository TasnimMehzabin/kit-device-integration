Remote device control is an integral part of device integration. The device integration protocol generally enables the
remote access and transfer of data. Users will be able to access the device through the Chemotion ELN.

### Configurations in source PC
This has been achieved by the installation of the software, [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php) (Installer
for Windows, 64-bit). Users can access the computer remotely through Chemotion ELN through this. We have to configure it
as follows,

On the setup screen, we have to select the TightVNC server to be installed along with the set up of the passwords for
remote access and administrative password.

## Remote Device Control

In the initial step, in order to get access to the device, the user has to belong to the Theato group in Chemotion-ELN. Any user who belongs to the group, **Device Pool AK Theato** in Chemotion-ELN will have access to the device. If the user is not already in the group, then the group admin, Dr. Dominik Voll will have to add the user from Chemotion-ELN [(Demo)](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/8281021?key=ef9b0f2259b993205c37f9f25f848827).

For a user who is in the group, the user has to log in to the Chemotion-ELN at [https://complat-eln.ioc.kit.edu/home](https://complat-eln.ioc.kit.edu/home). Then he can access the device.

There are two modes of remote access.
- Blur
- Focus

Initially the device loads in **Blur** mode where the user is only able to observe the device and not able to take any actions.

If the user wants to interact with the computer, then he must select the **Focus** mode. Then he can work with the computer and perform all types of actions [(Demo)](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/8281146?key=f563733a252757c51be8b039609c05e5).
