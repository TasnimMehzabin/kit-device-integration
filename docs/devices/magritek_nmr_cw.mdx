This protocol allows remote access to the PC running Spinsolve and the transfer of experiment data to the Chemotion ELN’s inbox.

We have to take care that the name conventions are communicated to all users of Chemotion ELN:

## Integrated Devices
- Magritek NMR

## Specifications of Device
- Software Name: Spinsolve
- Connected to Internet/Intranet: Yes
- Data files generated: 1D file (.1d)

## Target Points

 - **Remote Device Control:** We can control the integrated devices through Chemotion-ELN. This has been achieved
 by the installation of the software, TightVNC. It works in a similar way as TeamViewer. Users can access the computer remotely through Chemotion-ELN.

  - **Data Transfer:** Whenever the experiment is completed and a new data experiment is conducted, we have to name the sample according to the naming convention [below](/docs/devices/magritek_nmr_cw#sample-naming-convention-details). Thus the file is transferred to ELN automatically.

## Data Transfer

The NMR's PC and the Chemotion ELN both need access to a common network storage location. Here LSDF storage service has been used which has been later on mounted in the NMR’s PC as (Z:) drive under Netzwerkadressen i.e. Network Address.

When we look at Spinsolve's data storage settings, we can see that the data is stored both locally and on a remote server. Both of these locations have recently been modified to improve the overall data transfer procedure.

First of all, instead of (C:) drive as the local storage location, we have now moved it to the  (E:) drive. The path is as follows,

```
E:\DATA
```

Now as for the remote backup storage location, (Z:) drive will be used instead of (Y:) drive. Here we have to consider some points.

- Here Z:\ELN is the location where the experiment data file will be automatically saved besides the local drive and  Chemotion ELN will be able to retrieve and transfer it to the appropriate user's inbox. Chemotion, however, follows a mechanism that will remove the file from this location once it has been retrieved. To keep the files backed up, the user must copy all of the data files from the local location to the following backup folder on a regular basis, perhaps once or twice a month.
  ```
  Z:\Data manual Backup
  ```

- The next point is regarding the naming of the sample. We have to make sure that the sample name follows the name conventions [rules](/docs/devices/magritek_nmr_cw#sample-naming-convention-details).

- The output file will, then, be automatically saved to the remote storage location and eventually, it will be available in the specific user inbox in Chemotion ELN [(Demo)](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/8282250?key=33d387cb0a14e86e65dff8a9cb393b92), if the name convention is right.


## Sample Naming Convention Details

:::info
We have to make sure to communicate the naming convention rules to all users, [https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/devices#name-conventions](https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/devices#name-conventions)
:::

We have to make sure that the sample is properly named while conducting an experiment following the naming convention rules. To ensure proper data transfer to Chemotion ELN, we must ensure the following:

- Since the output files are transferred to the inbox for a particular user, the Kürzel of the user will identify to which user the file is to be sent. From the Kürzel part, Chemotion ELN will identify it automatically. So it is important to specify the Kürzel properly at this point.

So the samples has to be named using the following format,

**User Identifier (Name abbreviation/Kürzel) - SampleName**

For example, if the name abbreviation for the user is 1DV, then the sample has to be named as follows,

> 1DV-SampleName
