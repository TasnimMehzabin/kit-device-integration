Several devices on campus West and South have been listed to be integrated with Chemotion-ELN. Going by that plan, we
have started with the device, THF-SEC in campus North. This protocol allows remote access to the PC running PSS winGPC
and the transfer of experiment data to the Chemotion ELN’s inbox.

We have to take care that the name conventions are communicated to all users of Chemotion ELN:

## Integrated Devices
- THF-SEC
- DMAC

## Specifications of Device
- Software Name: PSS winGPC
- Connected to Internet/Intranet: Yes
- Data files generated: .txt files

## Target Points

 - **Remote Device Control:** We can control the integrated devices through Chemotion-ELN. This has been achieved
 by the installation of the software, TightVNC. It works in a similar way as TeamViewer. Users can access the computer remotely through Chemotion-ELN.

  - **Data Transfer:** Whenever the experiment is completed and a new data file is generated, we have to first rename the file according to the naming convention [below](/docs/thf_sec_cw#file-naming-convention-details) and then transfer the file to a specific folder. Afterwards the file is transferred to ELN automatically.

## Remote Device Control

In the initial step, in order to get access to the device, the user has to belong to the Theato group in Chemotion-ELN. Any user who belongs to the group, **Device Pool AK Theato** in Chemotion-ELN will have access to the device. If the user is not already in the group, then the group admin, Dr. Dominik Voll will have to add the user from Chemotion-ELN [(Demo)](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/8281021?key=ef9b0f2259b993205c37f9f25f848827).

For a user who is in the group, the user has to log in to the Chemotion-ELN at [https://complat-eln.ioc.kit.edu/home](https://complat-eln.ioc.kit.edu/home). Then he can access the device.

There are two modes of remote access.
- Blur
- Focus

Initially the device loads in **Blur** mode where the user is only able to observe the device and not able to take any actions.

If the user wants to interact with the computer, then he must select the **Focus** mode. Then he can work with the computer and perform all types of actions [(Demo)](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/8281146?key=f563733a252757c51be8b039609c05e5).

## Data Transfer

This step must be properly followed in order to ensure proper data transfer mechanisms.

- While saving the file at the local location in the computer, the user has to name the file following the [naming convention](/docs/thf_sec_cw#file-naming-convention-details). In this case the local location is **C:\Data**.

- Before the software can finish writing the file, the naming must be ensured. Once all of the data has been entered into the file by the software, it will be copied to a remote location so that Chemotion can retrieve it. If the file name is modified after that, a new file with the new name will be transferred.

- In case your file has been saved already without proper naming convention, just make some insignificant changes, like pressing an enter and save the file once again with proper naming. Then it will be transferred to Chemotion properly.

- After the file is transferred, it will be available in the specific user inbox in Chemotion-ELN [(Demo)](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/video/8282250?key=33d387cb0a14e86e65dff8a9cb393b92).

## File Naming Convention Details

:::info
We have to make sure to communicate the naming convention rules to all users, [https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/devices#name-conventions](https://www.chemotion.net/chemotionsaurus/docs/eln/devices#name-conventions)

Following points have to be considered to ensure proper data transferring to Chemotion-ELN,

- Since the files are transferred to the inbox for a particular user, the Kürzel of the user will identify to which user the file is to be sent. From the Kürzel part, Chemotion-ELN will identify it automatically. So it is important to specify the Kürzel properly at this point.

- Since files from two devices are to be imported from the same computer, the device identifier is to be used to distinguish between them.

So the files to be transferred has to be named using the following format,

**User Identifier (Name abbreviation/Kürzel) - Device Identifier (THF/DMAC) - filename**

For example, if the name abbreviation for the user is 1DV and the file is from THF-SEC, then the file has to be named as follows,

> 1DV-THF-filename

For a file from DMAC, the naming will be as follows for the same user,

>  1DV-DMAC-filename
